-- GoTrue scans these auth.users token columns into Go string fields; a NULL
-- value (left by rows inserted manually/via seed without specifying them)
-- causes "converting NULL to string is unsupported" and breaks login for
-- that user entirely. Backfill any NULLs to '' across all users, not just
-- the seeded StoreNode HQ account, so this can't recur for other rows.
